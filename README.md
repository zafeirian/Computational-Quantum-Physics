# Computational Quantum Physics and Applications
This is a repository for the Master's course "Computational Quantum Physics" of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, which is composed of two projects.
# First Project
The first project was the studying of the informational entropy of a quantum system. It required obtaining data from a paper using an OCR program and finding a way of inserting the data into a dataset, so that the whole project can be automated. After that, a script was written in order to compute several units of informational entropy for the atoms of Z=2 to Z=10 and visualise them.

# Second Project
The second project was the implementation of machine and deep learning methods in order to create a classification model that accurately predicts whether a set of experimental data from the LHC, studying the Higgs Boson, corresponds to a signal or background noise. The machine learning classification methods that were implemented were KNN and Random Forest. The deep learning classification method was an implementation of a sequential ANN using the tensorflow/keras python library.
