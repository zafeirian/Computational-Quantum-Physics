# Computational Quantum Physics and Applications  

This repository contains projects for the Master's course **"Computational Quantum Physics"** at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It includes two major projects focused on quantum systems and machine/deep learning applications in physics.  

## **First Project: Quantum Informational Entropy Analysis**  
The first project involved studying the **informational entropy of quantum systems**. Key tasks included:  
- Extracting data from a research paper using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**.  
- Processing and structuring the extracted data into a usable dataset for automation.  
- Developing a Python script to compute various **informational entropy measures** for atoms with atomic numbers **Z = 2 to Z = 10**.  
- Visualizing the results to analyze entropy trends across different quantum states.  

## **Second Project: Higgs Boson Signal Classification**  
The second project applied **machine learning and deep learning** techniques to classify experimental data from the **Large Hadron Collider (LHC)**. The goal was to distinguish between **Higgs boson signals** and **background noise**. Implemented methods include:  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  - **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Deep Learning Model**:  
  - A **Sequential Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**.  

The project involved preprocessing the dataset, optimizing model performance, and evaluating classification accuracy.
